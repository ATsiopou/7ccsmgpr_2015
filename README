How to form a team:

  1) Designate a team coordinator.
  2) Have the coordinator fork this repository.
  3) Create a directory in your fork called "team_X" where X is the name
     of your team.
  4) In your team_X directory create a filed called "members.txt"
  5) For each team member:
       Find your name in the students.txt file and copy that whole line
       into team_X/members.txt (preserve the student number, tabs etc.)
  6) Add and commit your "team_X/members.txt" and push it to your fork.
  7) Send a pull request.

If you get any of these details wrong, you will be asked to try again.
